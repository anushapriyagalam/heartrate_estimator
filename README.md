#Real-time Estimation of Heart Rate under lighting using Web Camera
Developed a real-time heart rate detection system using a standard webcam, applying OpenCV and signal processing techniques.
Extracted heart rate from facial video frames by detecting skin color changes through LAB color space conversion and blind source separation (BSS).
Achieved 90% accuracy under varying lighting conditions for indoor use in healthcare settings.
